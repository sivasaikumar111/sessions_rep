						HOW TO CREATE A SNAPSHOTS?

.First create a new public instances using key pair for secure connection to the instances
	.To create a public instances we have to enable Auto-assign public instances in network setting while creating the instances

.After creating a new instance connect to that instance
	.In that instance use sudo su command to switch as a root user
	.After switching as a root user install git, java,  docker
		yum install git -y
		yum install java-17-amazon-corretto-devel -y
		yum install docker -y
.Later installing all the tools in the server comeback to the instances page in AWS and click on the storage which under the instances

.It will show the volume created to that instances by click on the volume id it will navigates to the volume page

.in the volume page select the volume that is attached to our instance then click on action a dropdown list will open click on create snapshot in that it will navigates to create snapshot page

.In that give the description of the snapshot click on create snapshot in the left bottom of the page

.now the snapshot of the volume is created

.In the snapshot page select the snapshot that we have created click on the action button a dropdown list will open in that click on create volume form snapshot

.Create a volume page will open in that carefully select the availability zone that we need to create instances finally click on create volume in the left bottom of the page

.now the new volume is created using the snapshot that we created

.Then create an another new instances using the same key pair but in the same availability zone that new volume we have created

.now stop that second instance we created and detach the volume that is default created by instance

.Next go the volume select the volume that we created using snapshot go the actions click on it a dropdown list will open click on attach volume

.Attach volume page will open in that page select the second instances id select the device name as /dev/xvda and click on attach the volume in left bottom

.Now open the second instances using connect option

.In the second instances use sudo su command and switch as a root user

	git --version
	java --version
	docker --version
.By using the above three command we can check whether the tools are installed in the instances are not
